# My Awesome Password Generator

## This is my first working application

- My movtivation for making this i wanted to see if i could create what i learned in class.

* I build this application so i could use in a later date when i cant come up with passwords

* There are a few issues at the beginning. I wanted to added checkboxes so you can pick which character you wanted to have for your password but i come to realize that it would be simpler to just have popup asking if they want to have speical characters.

* I learned that if i want to get better i will need to keep on updateing and or make changes to get better a javascript.
  *Below is the image of my website and link.
